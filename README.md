# Ping-Pong

Ping-Pong game with a python code

This code sets up a very basic version of a ping-pong game where two players can control paddles with the w, s keys for the left player and Up, Down arrow keys for the right player. The ball bounces off walls and paddles, resetting when it passes the paddles.

To run this code, make sure you have Python installed with the turtle module available. You can copy this into a Python file (e.g., ping_pong.py) and execute it to play the game.
